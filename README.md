# Basecalling
Basecalling snakemake for nanopore sequencing

## Data
This script converts the pod5 files generated during sequencing into fastq.gz files. It can start with a .tar file or the decompressed files insie `resources/Data/pod5`

## Note 
I haven't been able to run the snakemake script. I'm using the scripts in `scripts/`
